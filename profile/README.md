# Welcome to I Know My LLM

We're building a community manifesto for spotting hype and promoting trustworthy AI platforms. Through our work and collective experience, we prioritize **Evidence over Promises**, **Transparency over Hype**, and **Accountability over Obscurity**.

## 🎯 What We Do

The "I Know My LLM" manifesto provides **8 actionable principles** to help you evaluate AI platforms and protect yourself from fraud:

1. **Verify Credentials Thoroughly** — Dig into roles, histories, and team depth
2. **Demand Concrete Proof** — Require working demos and verifiable references
3. **Spot Hype and Jargon** — Identify invented terms and unsubstantiated claims
4. **Audit Security Independently** — Check certifications and data practices
5. **Research Regulatory Standing** — Review FINRA, SEC, FCA filings
6. **Question Urgency and Terms** — Challenge artificial scarcity and unfair deals
7. **Document Everything** — Record claims and communications for accountability
8. **Leverage Instincts and Community** — Trust your gut and collective wisdom
